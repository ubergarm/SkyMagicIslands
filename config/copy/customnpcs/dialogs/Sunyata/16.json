    "DialogText": "Usually folks build a small Davinci's Vessels' airship with few balloons and a helm. Be warned though, while your friends can ride with you in a seat, they will fall off during a trip down to the Nethercore or back up! Also, a sleeping bag can provide comforts through long nights.

I've heard that ancient mineshafts can be found in Mountain and Alps biomes; lavender fields, orchards, and  meadows tend to be more peaceful. Perhaps you can craft a device to locate them?

The path of the Monk can give you a strong foundation upon which to develop your magical acumen. Rumors of floating monks stir about still today, though I've never seen it myself.

Good luck finding your own personal Philosopher's Stone!",
