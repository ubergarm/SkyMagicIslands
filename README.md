Find out which are peaceful (not spawning mobs) and which are more dangerous than others (spawning powerful Mutant mobs)!

What are you waiting for?! Go get started with this magical blend of
mods only all available in Mineraft 1.12.2!!!

## Getting Started
A few tips to start you off on the right foot:

* You must "turn in" a completed quest with the NPC that gave it to you to receive your reward!
* After "turning in" your first quest with "Sunyata", you will receive everything needed to begin using EMC and completing more quests.
* You can access NPC Quest Log by rebinding the `L` key or by using the tab above your inventory on the right.
* You can craft better quality Transmutation Tables and Tablets before completing the Philosopher Stone quest!
* You will need to use the JEI to figure out creative ways to transmute items into other items using different mods' recipes. You can also find many useful and high EMC items by simply exploring the structures that generate on many of the islands.
* Many mods provide Achievements to guide your progress but might need to be unlocked before the tab is visible. For example, punch and break 10 wood logs with your bare hands while not wearing any armor to unlock `The Monk Mod` Achievements. This mod pack uses NPC quests to provide more organic and open exploration of the various magical mods and does *not* add any explicit step-by-step task Achievements other than those that come with the mods.

This modpack is designed with small private multiplayer servers in mind,
so of course you can divide up the crafting items for the Philosopher's
Stone quest and then all complete it by sharing your items and EMC
knowledge with friends!

## Installation

* ~6GB RAM seems fine for client; less okay for small server.
* I suggest turning off fog, clouds, and to disable auto-jump.
* If your PC can handle it, turn up render distance a bit to 10 or 12.
* During world generation select the default `Sky Magic Islands` an do *NOT* click `preview`.

*IMPORTANT NOTE*: Do *NOT* update Modular Mechanics/Magic/Diversity or
you will break the pack! I specifically chose these versions as they are
the newest that work together. It's not a perfect solution, but unless
Modular Diversity updates or Modular Magic adds in better coverage this
is the state of things. If you did update and break your pack, manually
downgrade to these exact versions:

* `Modular Diversity-1.10.jar`
* `modularmachinery-1.12.2-1.10.0.jar`
* `modularmagic-1.4.0.jar`

## Server
Make sure to download the server zip file for the same version as the client from here:
[curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/sky-magic-islands/files)

#### Example Linux Installation
Make sure to read the EULA, configure the startup script for the
amount of RAM available on your server, and edit the `server.properties`:

* `unzip SkyMagicIslands-Server-v0.9.4-Minecraft-v1.12.2.zip`
* `cd SkyMagicIslands`
* `cp server.properties.example server.properties`
* `echo "eula=true" > eula.txt`
* `./start.sh`

Windows will be very similar, but you might need a `start.bat` file instead.

#### Mohist Server
This modpack was developed using
[forge-1.12.2-14.23.5.2854](http://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.12.2.html)
but also has pretty good compatibility with
[Mohist](https://github.com/Mohist-Community/Mohist) as well if you want
or need a hybrid server implementing Forge/Paper/Spigot/Bukkit APIs. There
are some known issues with specific tileEntities with issues open on
their tracker. You can find the
[latest Mohist 1.12.2 server jar build here](https://ci.codemc.io/job/Mohist-Community/job/Mohist-1.12.2/lastBuild/).

Please confirm any unusual behavior while using Mohist is also present
under Forge before reporting bugs so you know where to report it.

If you choose Mohist, you might need to configure the vaious `.yml` files it creates.

#### Scoreboard
Some commands for you and your friends to work together on the Philosopher
Stone quest on a multiplayer server.
[Neat](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/neat) also displays
entity names so it looks better to disable nametagVisibility:

* `scoreboard teams add TeamMagic TeamMagic`
* `scoreboard teams join TeamMagic player1`
* `scoreboard teams join TeamMagic player2`
* `scoreboard teams join TeamMagic player3`
* `scoreboard teams option TeamMagic friendlyfire false`
* `scoreboard teams option TeamMagic nametagVisibility never`

#### Pregenerate Chunks
It is highly recommended to pregenerate chunks for both stability and performance!
Example commands to start/stop generating 100 chunk radius around your x/z location
in the Overworld dimension (you need to have OPs):

* `/pregen gen startradius square ~ ~ 100 0 TerrainOnly`
* `/pregen stop`
* `/pregen clear`

I recommend using `TerrainOnly` as I noticed a glitch with un-openable
loot chests in structures after doing full pregeneration.

#### Visual Metrics
For anyone self hosting I suggest checking out
[Netdata](https://github.com/netdata/netdata) to provide pretty and easy
system metrics to help keep an eye on sever resources and load. You can
even run it in docker!

#### Pin and renice the tickUpdate thread
Some advanced linux commands for all the SysOps out there, find the
pid of the tickUpdate task and pin it to a single cpu core an give it
slight priority to make it easier to monitor how much CPU headroom you
have and how hard world gen hits you.

* Learn to recognize what is usually the 2nd highest process on CPU usage:
* `$ htop`
* Pin the process if you have multiple cores so the scheduler leaves it alone:
* `$ sudo taskset -p 04 pid`
* Renice the process to give it slight priority over other user threads:
* `$ sudo renice -n -1 pid`

## Resource Packs
Many of these mods have great resource packs available
over at [bdcraft forums](https://bdcraft.net/) if you
can't find it on [curseforge](https://curseforge.com) first. I also highly recommend
[Fatasy Ores](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/fantasy-ores-by-cesarzorak)
as well. For development I personally use about ~20ish packs at `64px` which cover a
lot of the mods without out-shining the mods with original textures imho.

[Here is a list of all the resurce packs used during development and for the screenshots](https://github.com/ubergarm/SkyMagicIslands/blob/master/resourcepacks/RESOURCEPACKS.md)

## Shaders
This modpack is compatible with
[OptiFine 1.12.2 HD U F6 pre1](https://optifine.net/) and many shaders.
I personally develop with optfine installed which gives some
performance benifits, the `c` button zoom features, and dynamic lighting,
but unfortunately many shaders are not very comptibe with the advanced
magical and particle effects many that these mods provide; therefore I don't
recommend using them to preserve original mod makers effects more accurately.

## Shout Outs
* [Mischief of Mice](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU3gwpclVZSYofj616OQKLQ) Valen goes in depth explaining mods bit by bit!

* [Mods Summed Up](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWUnrwn0-CNWnJbQ8XawEWdEnmRAFEgYk) Info-packed quick overviews of a single mod all summed up!
* [How To: Pack Dev](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJB-Y_FDFQZ7zVl-64Eb3hvhtUdLC20fq) IterationFunk keeps it funky and gives pro-tips that taught me much to create this pack!
* [Equivilent Skies](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/equivalent-skies) Inspired starting off with the new ProjectEX customized book of knowledge sharing!

Also a big shout out and thank you to my personal gaming and play-testing
crew of friends: `katgoespewpew`, `Malkthius`, and `GregoryZamuza`! Without their
long hours trying to figure out confusing multiblock structures, fussing
with glitchy cauldrons, dealing with broom problems, and re-installing
the beta client multiple times in a week I never would have been able
to finish and test this pack!

Finally, thanks to you and all the players out there making this community great!
